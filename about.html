            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>I'm Regina Rabkina, a fourth-year student at Northeastern University, where I study Computer Science with Business Administration to bridge theory and real-world applications. Inspired by my family's programming background, I immersed myself in STEM courses early on. Furthermore, my love for technology and business led me to develop these skills through clubs, part-time consulting at Mondrus CCS, summer internships at the United Federation of Teachers, and a co-op at Flexcar. With a concentration in Marketing Analytics, I aim to leverage technology for analyzing human behavior in marketing. As graduation approaches, I'm eager to enter the Fintech industry, seeking roles such as Business Analyst, Software Engineer, or Project Manager to apply my diverse skill set.</p>
