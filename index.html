            <h2>WELCOME</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Regina Rabkina, a fourth-year student at Northeastern University, majoring in Computer Science and Business Administration, with a concentration in Marketing Analytics. My academic journey has been dedicated to cultivating strong technical skills, particularly in Java and Python programming and problem-solving, which I've developed through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects. </p>
            <p>My true passion lies in the intersection of technology and business. I'm also enthusiastic about the world of business and its dynamics! I'm excited to explore the application of technology in optimizing business processes, making informed decisions, and driving growth. I've had the opportunity to gain valuable insights from previous internships and courses, and I'm eager to further bridge the gap between theory and real-world experience. I'm always open to connecting with professionals who share a similar passion for technology and business, and I'm looking forward to exploring potential collaborations in this dynamic field.</p>
